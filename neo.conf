# Note: Unless otherwise noted, all parameters in this configuration file
# must be identical for all nodes in a given cluster.
# This file is optionnal: parameters can be given at the command line.

# Common parameters.
[DEFAULT]
# The cluster name
# This must be set.
# IMPORTANT: It must be a name unique to a given cluster, to prevent foreign
# misconfigured nodes from interfering.
cluster: test

# The list of master nodes
# Master nodes not not in this list will be rejected by the cluster.
# This list should be identical for all nodes in a given cluster for
# maximum availability.
masters: 127.0.0.1:10000

# Partition table configuration
# Data in the cluster is distributed among nodes using a partition table, which
# has the following parameters.
# Replicas: How many copies of a partition should exist at a time.
#   0 means no redundancy
#   1 means there is a spare copy of all partitions
replicas: 1
# Partitions: How data spreads among storage nodes.
# IMPORTANT: This can not be changed once the cluster contains data.
partitions: 12
# The maximum number of usable storage nodes is: partitions * (replicas + 1)

# Master-slave asynchronous replication
# The following 2 options are only required if you want to backup another
# NEO cluster.
;upstream_cluster: test2
;upstream_masters: 127.0.0.1:30000

# Individual nodes parameters
# Some parameters makes no sense to be defined in [DEFAULT] section.
# They are:
# bind: The ip:port the node will listen on.
# database: Storage nodes only. Syntax for:
#   - MySQL: [user[:password]@]database[unix_socket]
#     Database must be created manually.
#   - SQLite: path

# Admin node
[admin]

# Master nodes
[master]
bind: 127.0.0.1:10000

# Storage nodes
[storage]
database: neo:neo@neo1
