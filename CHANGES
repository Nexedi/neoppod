Change History
==============

0.10.1 (2012-03-13)
-------------------

- Client didn't limit its memory usage when committing big transactions.
- Master failed to disconnect clients when cluster leaves RUNNING state.

0.10 (2011-10-17)
-----------------

- Storage was unable or slow to process large-sized transactions.
  This required to change protocol and MySQL tables format.
- NEO learned to store empty values (although it's useless when managed by
  a ZODB Connection).

0.9.2 (2011-10-17)
------------------

- storage: a specific socket can be given to MySQL backend
- storage: a ConflictError could happen when client is much faster than master
- 'verbose' command line option of 'neomigrate' did not work
- client: ZODB monkey-patch randomly raised a NameError

0.9.1 (2011-09-24)
------------------

- client: method to retrieve history of persistent objects was incompatible
  with recent ZODB and needlessly asked all storages systematically.
- neoctl: 'print node' command (to get list of all nodes) raised an
  AssertionError.
- 'neomigrate' raised a TypeError when converting NEO DB back to FileStorage.

0.9 (2011-09-12)
----------------

Initial release.

NEO is considered stable enough to replace existing ZEO setups, except that:

- there's no backup mechanism (aka efficient snapshoting): there's only
  replication and underlying MySQL tools

- MySQL tables format may change in the future
