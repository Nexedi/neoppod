Change History
==============

0.9.1 (2011-09-24)
------------------

- client: method to retrieve history of persistent objects was incompatible
  with recent ZODB and needlessly asked all storages systematically.
- neoctl: 'print node' command (to get list of all nodes) raised an
  AssertionError.
- 'neomigrate' raised a TypeError when converting NEO DB back to FileStorage.

0.9 (2011-09-12)
----------------

Initial release.

NEO is considered stable enough to replace existing ZEO setups, except that:

- there's no backup mechanism (aka efficient snapshoting): there's only
  replication and underlying MySQL tools

- MySQL tables format may change in the future
