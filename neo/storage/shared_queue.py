    """Unidirectional pipe for asynchronous and fast exchange of big amounts
    of data between 2 processes.

    It is implemented using shared memory, a few locks and msgpack
    serialization. While the latter is faster than C pickle, it was mainly
    chosen for its streaming API while deserializing, which greatly reduces
    the locking overhead for the consumer process.

    There is no mechanism to end a communication, so this information must be
    in the exchanged data, for example by choosing a marker object like None:
    - the last object sent by the producer is this marker
    - the consumer stops iterating when it gets this marker

    As long as there are data being exchanged, the 2 processes can't change
    roles (producer/consumer).
