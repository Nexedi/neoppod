? Load vs "deleted" -> err or data=nil ?  -> stor.Conn flag
? IStorage.Load -> per storage connection

? random access -> mmap

----------------------------------------

- TODO stats for events (packets received, errors, etc)

- custom memory manager is required to avoid performance hit on e.g. []byte alloc/dealloc

  -> go-slab

- interfaces conversion in hot codepaths are costly:

  e.g. having r as io.ReadSeeker and converting it to io.Reader e.g. this way:


	io.ReadFull(r, ...)

  calls convI2I all the time (no caching) which is not negliable



- x/net/trace to trace requests and connection logging (and packets ?)
- packet log; general log -> glog ?

- gRPC eventually instead of hand-made protocol ?

go.leveldb      - study
go.groupcache   - study

groupcache -> consistenthash (-> fork-splitted)
