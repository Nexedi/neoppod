- custom memory manager is required to avoid performance hit on e.g. []byte alloc/dealloc

  -> go-slab

- interfaces conversion in hot codepaths are costly:

  e.g. having r as io.ReadSeeker and converting it to io.Reader e.g. this way:


	io.ReadFull(r, ...)

  calls convI2I all the time (no caching) which is not negliable



- "Go Execution Tracer"

go.leveldb      - study
go.groupcache   - study

groupcache -> consistenthash (-> fork-splitted)
