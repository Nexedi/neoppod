Although NEO is considered ready for production use in most cases, there are
a few bugs to know because they concern basic features of ZODB, or promised
features of NEO.
All the listed bugs will be fixed with high priority.

Conflict resolution not fully implemented
-----------------------------------------

When a cluster has several storage nodes, so-called 'deadlock avoidance' may
happen to in order to resolve conflicts. In such cases, conflicts will not be
resolved even if your _p_resolveConflict() method would succeed, leading to a
normal ConflictError.
Although this should happen rarely enough not to affect performance, this can
be an issue if your application can't afford restarting the transaction,
e.g. because it interacted with external environment.

Master failure not recovered by clients
---------------------------------------

After a master failure, clients are stuck in a bad state. In particular, caches
are not flushed, which could lead to data corruption if they reconnect a master.
This makes secondary masters mostly useless for the moment.

Storage failure or update may lead to POSException or break undoLog()
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Storage nodes are only queried once at most and if all (for the requested
partition) failed, the client raises instead of asking the master whether it
had an up-to-date partition table (and retry if useful).
In the case of undoLog(), incomplete results may be returned.
