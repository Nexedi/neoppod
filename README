This is the second prototype of NEO. The design is described in:

    http://www.nexedi.org/workspaces/neo

TODO

    - Handling connection timeouts.

    - Handling write timeouts.

    - IdleEvent for a certain message type as well as a message ID

    - Flushing write buffers only without reading packets

    - Garbage collection of unused nodes

    - Stopping packet processing by returning a boolean value from
      a handler, otherwise too tricky to exchange a handler with another
